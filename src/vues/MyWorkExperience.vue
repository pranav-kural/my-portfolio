                            I worked as a fulltime web developer and Student Researcher in my first Co-op at the Center for Innovation and Applied Research (CARI), Georgian College. My primary tasks included:
                            <br>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Developing website based on the WordPress platform</li>
                                  <li>Interacting with and managing clients</li>
                                  <li>Designing websites from scratch (wireframing and prototyping)</li>
                                  <li>Building, customizing and designing the themes based on client needs and user cases</li>
                                  <li>Customizing plugins to support client needs</li>
                                  <li>Training clients to use their website and the CMS</li>
                                  <li>Representing CARI at certain events organized by CARI, Georgian College or partners. (Voluntarily).</li>
                              </ul>
                              Besides the technical skills (WordPress, Website designing, User Experience and website development), I also got the opportunity to learn and gain a lot soft skills:
                              interacting with clients, assessing client needs, reporting the work or tasks completed in department (or team) meetings, formal as well as informal communication with
                              the clients (or prospective clients), representing the CARI at events and in client meetings.
                              <br>
                              I was rehired as a part-time web developer in January 2017 after my co-op term ended in December 2016.
